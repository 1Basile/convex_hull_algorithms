# Convex Hull algorithms lib and Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation visualization
Program/Lib provides some algorithms to compute convex hull for given points, and test program to check them.
It also provides visualization of Voronoi diagram and Delaunay triangulation Quickhull, and all other algorithms.
